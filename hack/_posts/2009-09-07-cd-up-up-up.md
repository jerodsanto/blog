title: "cd up, up, and a-up"
excerpt: "We all know that <code>.</code> represents the current working directory and <code>..</code> represents the current working directory's parent directory. If we follow this pattern to its logical conclusion, then <code>...</code> would represent the current working directory's parent's parent, etc. Unfortunately, <code>cd</code> doesn't work that way."

Command-line jockeys are intimately familiar with the `cd` command. We've typed commands like this one a gozillion times:

{% highlight console %}
jerod@mbp:~/src/ruby/rails$ cd ..
jerod@mbp:~/src/ruby$
{% endhighlight %}

We all know that `.` represents the current working directory and `..` represents the current working directory's parent directory. If we follow this pattern to its logical conclusion, then `...` would represent the current working directory's parent's parent, etc. Unfortunately, `cd` doesn't work that way.

{% highlight console %}
jerod@mbp:~src/ruby/rails$ cd ...
-bash: cd: ...: No such file or directory
jerod@mbp:~$
{% endhighlight %}

Total bummer!

Instead, we have to repeat ourselves for every directory up we want to move. So, we end up typing commands that look like this:

{% highlight console %}
jerod@mbp:~/src/ruby/rails$ cd ../..
jerod@mbp:~/src$
{% endhighlight %}

The more directories up to move in the file system, the more ridiculous the command becomes:

{% highlight console %}
jerod@mbp:~/src/ruby/rails/box-office/app/models$ cd ../../../../..
jerod@mbp:~/src$
{% endhighlight %}

{% aside notice %}
in this contrived example, cd ~/src would be a much better way of navigating
{% endaside %}

If you've ever typed a command like that one, you feel my pain. I put up with this for a long time, but I've finally had enough of it. Here is a simple **bash** function that allows us to simply append **_._**'s to the **_cd_** command for each directory we want to move up.

[some guy](/2009/09/cd-up-up-up/#comment-16188007) pointed out that my function didn't correctly handle pathnames with spaces in it and he was kind enough to supply a simplified function to the one I wrote.
{% endaside %}

{% highlight bash %}
function cd () {
  if [[ $# > 0 ]]; then
    if [ ${1:0:2} == '..' ]; then
      rest=${1:2}
      rest=${rest//./../}
      builtin cd "${1:0:2}/${rest}"
    else
      builtin cd "$1"
    fi
  else
    builtin cd
  fi
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is a simple wrapper function that ends up calling the shell's built-in `cd` command. Drop it in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` and give it a whirl!

{% highlight console %}
jerod@mbp:~/src/ruby/rails$ cd ...
jerod@mbp:~/src$
{% endhighlight %}

Much better!

{% aside notice %}
I added this function to my `.bashrc` which I store in a [dotfiles repo on GitHub](http://github.com/jerodsanto/dotfiles/tree/master). Feel free to check it out and see if there's any other useful tricks you can add to your command-line r√©pertoire.
