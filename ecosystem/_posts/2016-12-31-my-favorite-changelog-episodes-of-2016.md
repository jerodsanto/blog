title: "My Favorite Changelog Episodes of 2016"
excerpt: "We had a lot of great conversations this year. These were my favorite."
---

We shipped 44 episodes of The Changelog in 2016. That's a lot of conversations!

All of our guests are interesting and insightful in their own ways, but there are a handful that continue to resonate with me in my work and life since we spoke with them. Here they are, in chronological order:

## Nadia Eghbal

Nadia's outsider (turned insider) take on open source and funding sparked debates and actions throughout the year. This topic is so near-and-dear to our hearts that we started an entirely new podcast with Nadia and co-host Mikeal Rogers: [Request For Commits](https://changelog.com/rfc).

## Matt Mullenweg

Matt's reputation preceeded him, but I was surprised at how soft-spoken, kind, and full of insights he is. I could talk to him for hours on end.

## Richard Hipp

This might actually be my #1 favorite. Sqlite's story is inspiring and Richard Hipp is a saint.

## Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz)

This was the show I was most nervous to record, and with good reason. It's Matz! He did not disappoint.

(For a behind-the-scenes look at just how nervous we were for this show, listen to [my conversation with Katrina Owen on Spotlight #2](https://changelog.com/spotlight/2))

## Pieter Hintjens

When Adam booked this show with Pieter to talk about his life and pending death, I thought he was nuts. Turned out he was genius, as its perhaps the show we're most proud of and beloved by tens of thousands. We miss you Pieter!

## Cory Doctorow

Cory is one of those guys who you can just wind up and watch him go. This was a challenging conversation, and I mean that in the best sense of the word.

## Sandi Metz

Last, but certainly not least. Sandi is so smart, so nice, and manages to teach you things while you don't even realize it. She deserves every bit of credit the greater Ruby community has given her over the years.

## Up Next

With guests like Linda Liukas, Steve Klabnik, Ashley Willams, and Nathan Sobo already booked, 2017 is shaping up to be another _excellent_ time to be a [Changelog listener](https://changelog.com/subscribe).
