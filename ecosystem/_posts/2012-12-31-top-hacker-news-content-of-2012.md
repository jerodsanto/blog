[Judofyr][judofyr]'s excellent [collection][judofyr-collection] of Hacker News threads with book recommendations made me want to see all of the best HN threads this year.

Thankfully, the [HNSearch API][hnsearch-api] makes this kind of data easy to get at so I hacked up a [quick script][gist] to do just that.

While I was at it, I grabbed the top submissions as well!

## Some thoughts and stats

I thought it was interesting to see how different the top submissions lists were when sorted by points and comments. Only three submissions found their way on to both lists (Kill Hollywood, Lighten Up, and Favorite Programming Language).

It was also interesting to see by how large a margin mapgrep's comment beat out the others. Over 100 votes!

Overall, there were 232,825 submissions to Hacker News in 2012 and 1,191,015 comments posted.

Busy year!
