My vote for **"GIF of the Year"** goes to...

![White men *can* dance](http://jerodsanto.net/drop/mavs-white-boy-dance.gif)

There's so much to love here. The Michael Jackson glove[^1]. The girlfriend who wants nothing to do with it. Home boy in the background pimpin' his soda. I've looped this one countless times in 2014.

What's your favorite GIF this year? Upload or link it up in the comments!

[^1]: I revel in the possibility of that guy having thought to himself, "I gotta remember to bring my Michael Jackson glove to the game!"
