title: "What Continuity Means to Me"
excerpt: "What happens when the most-awaited features become the most disappointing."
---

The features that had me the most excited with the advent of iOS 8 and Yosemite fall under Apple's [Continuity][continuity-ios] umbrella. From the marketing page:

> Apple products have always been designed to work together beautifully. But now they may really surprise you. With iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, you’ll be able to do more wonderful things than ever before.

Answer phone calls and send SMS messages from my laptop? Yes! AirDrop between my phone and my Mac? I've been asking for that since 2013!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Why, oh why, can’t I AirDrop from my Mac to my phone? Seems only logical. Mavericks?</p>&mdash; Jerod Santo (@jerodsanto) <a href="https://twitter.com/jerodsanto/status/382505294556721152">September 24, 2013</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Unfortunately, sometimes the most-awaited features become the most disappointing.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The ONE feature I was looking forward to in iOS 8 / Yosemite – AirDrop between phone and mac – has never worked for me.</p>&mdash; Jerod Santo (@jerodsanto) <a href="https://twitter.com/jerodsanto/status/558302237034688512">January 22, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It turns out that AirDrop's problem is that my mid-2011 Macbook Air is too old to support the feature[^1]. OK. Apple gets a pass on that one. But what of the other promises? Can Continuity keep them? Not so much:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Continuity means never having to say “I missed your iMessage.”</p>&mdash; Jerod Santo (@jerodsanto) <a href="https://twitter.com/jerodsanto/status/557733484417273856">January 21, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Now instead of just my phone buzzing incessantly when someone iMessages me, _all_ of my devices beep and buzz. It's like an Apple-branded flash mob. That's not all.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Continuity means swiping up/away a notification on my phone only to have it appear as unread on my laptop, iPad, and —you guessed it— phone.</p>&mdash; Jerod Santo (@jerodsanto) <a href="https://twitter.com/jerodsanto/status/575471839889092608">March 11, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Am I taking crazy pills or should swiping away a notification mark it as acknowledged? iOS doesn't think so. And thanks to Continuity, Yosemite doesn't think so either. "Connected like never before" means that both operating systems now propagate their annoying bugs to the other. And there's more.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Continuity means my Mac telling me I missed a call right after I hang up the call.</p>&mdash; Jerod Santo (@jerodsanto) <a href="https://twitter.com/jerodsanto/status/564078159369601024">February 7, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Mac-based phone calls might be the most disappointing feature of the lot. The ring is delayed. The connection often fails. When I silence a call on my phone it rings on my Mac instead. It's a hot mess[^2].

There's no doubt in my mind that these things are difficult to get right. It's a cocktail of software, hardware interfaces, networking protocols[^3], context, presence, and more. But still, I think we'd all be better off if Apple would've held off on Continuity until they really had it figured out. Half-baked features are sometimes worse than no features at all.

Oh well, maybe they'll get it right [in iOS 9][ios-9-stability].

[^1]: We'll see if it works when my shiny new 13" Retina Macbook Pro arrives next week!

[^2]: Ironically, as I was writing this a call came in from my phone, which was in the bedroom. I answered it from my Mac and it worked flawlessly. [See what I mean][continuity-call].

[^3]: I _believe_ the delay between the phone ringing on the phone and the Mac is Bluetooth-related.
