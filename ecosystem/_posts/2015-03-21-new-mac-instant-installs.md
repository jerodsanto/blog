title: "New Mac: Instant Installs"
excerpt: "Which apps found their way immediately on to my brand new Mac"
---

Spring is in the air and a shiny new 13" MacBook Pro is in my office[^1].

It will replace the mid-2011 13" MacBook Air that I'm writing this post with. Why aren't I writing it on my new machine? Because for the first time ever I've decided _not_ to migrate. My current install has been through 6 major operating system upgrades, countless experiments, untold hacks, and more. It's time to start fresh.

I'll be running the two machines side-by-side for the next couple weeks, only loading things I need on to the new one. This means every app has to prove itself to me again. No exceptions.

## Apps

I plan to write up a few posts as I make the transition, documenting what makes the cut and what doesn't. This post covers the instant installs that I didn't hesitate to install on day one. Since this is a work machine, these apps are all Serious Business&#8482;. You won't find games or family tree software in this lot. These apps help me make a living.

- [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) &mdash; For file sync and sharing, accept no substitutes. It's an amazing feeling to load up a new machine with Dropbox, wait a few minutes, and have all my most critical files downloaded and right where I left them.

- [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com/3) &mdash; Speaking of dual wielding, I'm one of those weirdos who uses two text editors: Vim and Sublime Text. ST 3 is an excellent editor, and I'm excited to see its author back from hiatus and making progress once again.

- [Chrome](http://google.com/chrome) &mdash; I fell out of love with Chrome as a day-to-day browser[^2], but it still has best-in-class Dev Tools, which is the only reason it makes the cut.

- [Audio Hijack](http://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/) &mdash; Because podcasting.

- [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) &mdash; The best documentation browser I've ever used. I almost forgot that it also makes docs available offline until a recent trip to the boondocks reminded me. So great.

- [Soulver](http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/) &mdash; I always have one or two Soulver sheets open while working. It sits in the sweet spot between Spotlight math and a full-on spreadsheet.

- [Moom](http://manytricks.com/moom/) &mdash; I wish I didn't need Moom. OS X should handle window management better[^3], but it doesn't. Moom fixes it.

- [Slack](http://slack.com) &mdash; Slack is team communication done right. Their Mac app, like everything else, is an absolute joy to use.

## Tweaks

iCloud now brings many settings with it. I was pleasently surprised to see even my text shortcuts synced over automatically.

Still, there are many tweaks that don't fall inside iCloud's purview. Here are a few I couldn't live without:

- [Make Caps Lock key act as ⌃, disable ⌃ key altogether](/2015/02/i-fought-the-rsi-and-the-rsi-almost-won/)

- Install [Ubuntu Mono](http://font.ubuntu.com), which is my favorite coding font

- Hot Corners: upper left = Mission Control, lower right = Sleep Display

## Next

There are a few apps I'm trying to live without[^4] and whole boat load of things I haven't set up yet.

I'll write another post next week with more apps I end up installing and tweaks I bring over. Follow along on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jerodsanto) or via [RSS](/feed.xml)[^5] so you won't miss it!

[^1]: 3.1 GHz i7, 16GB of RAM, 256GB SSD (for the curious)

[^2]: I use Safari as my main browser. Having all my browsers synced between my devices via iCloud is its killer feature.

[^3]: This is the _one_ thing Windows does better than OS X, in my experience.

[^4]: Sparrow and iTerm, to name two.

[^5]: It lives!
