title: "Debian 5.0 (Lenny) Released"
excerpt: "Almost every software package in my favorite server operating system has been upgraded!"
---

Its been almost 2 years since Debian 4.0 (Etch) was first released. Debian release cycles are so long (because of their commitment to stable releases, amongst other reasons) that they often fly off my radar.

I was completely surprised by this release, and almost every software package in my favorite server operating system has been upgraded!

Check out the [Release announcement][1]. The list of [new packages][2]. And the [Debian Administration][3] post which includes instructions on how to upgrade
