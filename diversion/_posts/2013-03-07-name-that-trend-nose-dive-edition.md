excerpt: "Fall, baby, fall"

I recently stumbled across a spectacular nose dive in public perception that I thought would make a fun diversion. Can you figure out what dataset this trend represents?

I'll give you a few hints:

1.  I found it after watching a trailer for a movie set to release in June
2.  I'll reiterate &mdash; it is related to public perception
3.  The data is sourced from [IMDB][imdb]

<div class="chart">
  <script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js"> {"dataSourceUrl":"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0Anc47_2p2GgFdGZfTjhYQ1VIdlZkSW1SMTk0ZTJKNkE&transpose=0&headers=0&range=A1%3AA8&gid=0&pub=1","options":{"vAxes":[{"useFormatFromData":true,"title":"Y Axis","formatOptions":{"source":"data","scaleFactor":null},"minorGridlines":{"count":"0"},"minValue":0,"viewWindowMode":"pretty","viewWindow":{"min":0,"max":10},"maxValue":10},{"useFormatFromData":true,"minValue":null,"viewWindow":{"min":null,"max":null},"maxValue":null}],"titleTextStyle":{"bold":true,"color":"#000","fontSize":16},"series":{"0":{"pointSize":7}},"curveType":"","booleanRole":"certainty","title":"","interpolateNulls":false,"animation":{"duration":500},"legend":"none","lineWidth":2,"hAxis":{"useFormatFromData":true,"title":"X Axis","minValue":null,"viewWindowMode":null,"viewWindow":null,"maxValue":null},"width":450,"height":320},"state":{},"view":{"columns":[{"calc":"emptyString","type":"string","sourceColumn":0},0]},"chartType":"LineChart","chartName":"Chart 1"}

Know what it is? Ready to find out?!

{% reveal %}
And the trend is...

Average IMDB ratings of movies directed by [M. Night Shyamalan](http://www.imdbcom/name/nm0796117/)!

Surprised? Probably not too much. He's been on quite the downward spiral since the glories days of [The Sixth Sense](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167404/) (8.2) and [Unbreakable](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217869/) (7.2).

The trailer that inspired this trend spotting was for the Shyamlan written/directed [After Earth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1815862/). I was surpised to find out that he was involved since the trailer doesn't mention his name once. Ouch.
