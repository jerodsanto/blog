I decided to source out a few random Ruby scripts I use to interface with Amazon’s Simple Storage Service [(S3)][1] from the command line. Right now there are scripts which allow:

* Duplicating a local folder in a specified S3 bucket (recursively)
* Listing all buckets and files stored on an S3 account
* Uploading a specified file to a specified S3 bucket
* Downloading a specified file from a specified S3 bucket.

I’m sure the functionality will grow as needs arise. For now, check out the [repo on GitHub][2]
