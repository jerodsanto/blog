title: "My Dotjs Hack to Default Google Searches to Past Year"
excerpt: "Sick of clicking on 'More tools' and 'Past year' after almost all of your Google searches? I was, so I hacked together a dotjs quickie which adds the necessary params if they aren't already provided."

Sick of clicking on "More tools" and "Past year" after almost all of your Google searches? I was, so I hacked together a [dotjs][dotjs] quickie which adds the necessary params if they aren't already provided.

{% aside notice %}
Disclaimer: this has only been tested on searches performed from the omnibar. I can't remember the last time I visited google.com.
{% endaside %}

First, use Chrome as your browser. Next, install dotjs. Finally, drop this snippet into `~/.js/google.com.js`:

{% highlight javascript %}
if (window.location.pathname == "/search") {
  if (!window.location.href.match("&tbs=")) {
    window.location.href += "&tbs=qdr:y&tbo=1";
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you prefer your timely searches to be constrained differently, change the `tbs` param as follows:

* month = qdr:m
* week  = qdr:w
* day   = qdr:d

Recency is a big deal. One of these days Google will allow this as a setting in our search preferences. Until then, JavaScript FTW!
