Mephisto just wasn't cutting it so I switched blogging engines back to WordPress. I originally moved away from WordPress because I wanted to blog on Rails. Now that WordPress has matured as an open-source project (standard API, massive plugin/theme repository, advanced admin interface) I decided to finally cut back.

I used a nice little [python script][1] I found on GitHub to export my Mephisto database into WordPress and all is almost well. Some of the code in my old posts didn't port perfectly but I'll touch it up as I have time.

I also changed the permalink structure and ported my RSS feed into Google so I apologize if your reader got bombarded with my old posts.
