Dear web designers,

First, I want you to know that I admire your work. Really, I do.

I'm also a little jealous of your skills. There's nothing more frustrating than having design taste, but lacking what the French call a certain... I-don't-know-what to turn taste into tangible work product. That's where I live every day. But enough about me. This message is for you.

Every time I check out a newly launched website I do the following:

1.  Open it in Chrome
2.  See how it looks &amp; works
3.  Drag my Chrome window to as skinny as possible
4.  See how it looks &amp; works
5.  Judge the site

Sadly, more often than not I see an otherwise great website that totally fails its mobile users.

Guys and gals. It's 2012 and the mobile web is here in a big way. Just look at this pie chart from [All Things D][mobile-web-stats] back in May:

[![Mobile Web Chart][mobile-web-chart]][mobile-web-stats]

That's 20%, y'all. A big chunk. And it's just going to keep getting bigger every day.

**If you're not designing websites that adapt to mobile browser sizes, you need to be.**

If you don't have the skills, [get them][rwd-book]. If you need tools, they're [out][foundation] [there][gumby]. If your clients/bosses need convincing to invest a little extra, convince them.

Users will benefit. Site owners will benefit. You will benefit.

I don't know about you, but to me that sounds like a [win-win-win].
