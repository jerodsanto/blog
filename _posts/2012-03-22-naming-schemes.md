title: "Naming Schemes"
excerpt: "Naming things is hard. This website helps."

We all know that naming things is one of [the hard things][hard] in Computer Science. It turns out that this is also a problem in network/system administration. So many servers. So hard to come up with names for them all.

Naming schemes help, but they are also difficult to come up with. Thankfully, [there's a wiki for that][schemes].

A few characteristics of a good machine name:

1. One word, if possible &mdash; avoid the CamelCase v. under_score war
2. Memorable &mdash; If you need to look it up, you picked a bad name
3. Easy to spell &mdash; Help you help yourself
4. Not embarrasing &mdash; I once named a server "Woody" (whoops)

Any naming scheme chosen must provide a multitude of names that fit the chriteria above. Some of my favorite schemes from this list:

* [Bible Names][bible]
* [Big Lebowski Characters][lebowski]
* [Shakespeare Characters][shakespeare]
* [Elements][elements]
* [Fraggle Rock Characters][fraggle]
* [James Bond Villans][bond]
* [Mexican Foods][mexican]
* [Simpsons][simpsons]
* [Wrestlers][wrestlers]

So far I've usually stuck to TV show characters because they are memorable and plentiful. Series I've used as naming schemes include [Cheers][cheers] (hence: Woody), [M\*A\*S\*H][mash], and most recently [Arrested Development][ad].

![Gob the Illusionist][gob]

Come on, who wouldn't want a server names after that guy?!
