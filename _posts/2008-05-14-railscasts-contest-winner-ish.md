They say that second place is the first loser, but not in Ryan Bates’ most recent [Railscasts Contest][1] where all 10 winners were handsomely (handsome? Stop I’m blushing!) rewarded.

Even my humble 6th place nod was given $25 to [Amazon][2] and $50 to the [Pragmatic Bookshelf][3]! Yea, yea.

I know what you’re wondering. Which books did I choose? After much internal debate, I decided on [Advanced Rails Recipes][4] and [The Rails Way][5].

They should be delivered by Friday!
