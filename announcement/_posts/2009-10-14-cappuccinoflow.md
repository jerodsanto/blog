## In Brief

[<img title="CappuccinoFlow" src="http://blog.jerodsanto.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cf.png" height="125" alt="CappuccinoFlow" width="125" />][1]
I just launched <a href="http://cappuccinoflow.com" rel="external">CappuccinoFlow</a>: a community driven link blog for the <a href="http://www.cappuccino.org" rel="external">Cappuccino</a> framework. If you're at all interested in this amazing new technology out of <a href="http://280north.com/" rel="external">280north</a>, make sure to subscribe to the [RSS feed][2], follow along on <a href="http://twitter.com/cappuccinoflow" rel="external">Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://cappuccinoflow.com/items/new" rel="external">post</a> cool Cappuccino-related links to the flow!

## In Detail

It has been a little quiet around these parts lately. I blame Cappuccino.

For the uninitiated, Cappuccino is a framework for writing web applications (<a href="http://almost.at" rel="external">for example</a>). It is built on Objective-J, which is an Objective-C-esque superset of JavaScript. It is completely rad. Also, it's all client-side so I still get to use Rails on the back-end. I believe the apt word is: woot.

I wanted a link blog to support the small, but growing, Cappuccino community. I'm a big fan of <a href="http://rubyflow.com" rel="external">RubyFlow</a> so I contacted its creator, <a href="http://peterc.org" rel="external">Peter Cooper</a>, and asked him if I could set one up for Cappuccino. He was gracious enough to say yes, and he had conveniently <a href="http://github.com/Sutto/rubyflow/" rel="external">open-sourced</a> an old version of his site awhile back. I <a href="http://github.com/jerodsanto/cappuccinoflow" rel="external">forked it</a> on GitHub and the result is <a href="http://cappuccinoflow.com" rel="external">CappuccinoFlow</a>.

I'll probably have to modify my blog's headline soon, because once I become proficient in Objective-J & Cappuccino you'll probably see some posts about it.
