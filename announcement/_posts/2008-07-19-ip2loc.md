[ip2loc][4] is a simple tool which visualizes location data for a given IP address using the Google Maps API. I created it for a few reasons:

1. Most sites that do this charge or are clunky
2. I wanted to write a simple application with [Sinatra][2]
3. It was a good excuse to sharpen my [jQuery][3] skills
4. Boredom

[ip2loc][4] is powered by [Ruby][5], written with [TextMate][6], and deployed with [Passenger][7] on [DreamHost][8].
