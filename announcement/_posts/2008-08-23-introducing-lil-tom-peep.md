[lil tom peep][1] is a new web application I wrote to fix a problem I had with web surfing. I hate having to manually check up on semi-static web pages like blog comment streams and firmware update pages (basically anything missing RSS).

Now I just submit the page url and my email address to [lil tom peep][1] and he does the checking for me. Pretty basic, but very useful to me.

[ltp][1] is powered by [Sinatra][3]. Check out the [props][4] page to see all the technologies involved. Possible future features include RSS-integration and a bookmarklet. Let me know if you have any feature requests or encounter any bugs while using the service. Enjoy!
