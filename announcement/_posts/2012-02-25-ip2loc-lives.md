If you follow me on [Twitter][twitter], then you know that I was [a little upset][ip2loctweet] last week with regard to one of my little side projects, [ip2loc][ip2loc], which provides simple IP address to geographic location translation via a Google Map.

The full story isn't very interesting, but let's just say that a few unrighteous souls took advantage of the free service that I offered and ruined the fun for everyone.

In my frustration, I replaced the lookup form with a "*this is why we can't have nice things*" message and announced the service's retirement on Twitter.

(I just looked and my ip2loc announcement blog post was in July of 2008. That's a long time ago!)

### But

So many folks reached out to say thanks, offer assistance, and tell me how often they use the tool that I decided to bring it back to life.

### Compromises

In order to resurrect the service, I had to switch away from the paid [MaxMind][maxmind] web service that was powering it. This is worse in a few ways:

1. Accuracy suffers because the database is updated monthly instead of in realtime

2. It no longer displays ISP information for each IP

3. There is now a PayPal donate button for those who *really* appreciate the tool


All in all I think these deficincies are worth suffering to keep the service online. Rarely a week goes by that I don't run a lookup myself, so I am happy to be able to bring it back.
