I competed in the first ever <a href="http://nodeknockout.com/">Node Knockout</a> over the weekend with a <a href="http://twitter.com/jmhobbs">couple</a> of <a href="http://twitter.com/codypeterson">friends</a> and the fruit of our labor is an 8-bit multiplayer shooter called LazerCatz!

It was my first foray into <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node</a> and I have to say that event-based programming is a lot easier in the browser than it is on the server, at least for me anyways. There was still tons of fun to be had and the awesome <a href="http://faye.jcoglan.com/">Faye</a> library made implementing a real-time game between many players a breeze.

Please <a href="http://www.lazercatzthegame.com">check out the game</a> and <a href="http://nodeknockout.com/teams/lazercatz">vote/review it</a> if you have some free time. Also, if you want to participate next year please let me know, we were short a person this time around and we could have benefited from another set of hands.
