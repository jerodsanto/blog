I've been quietly publishing a [Bible podcast](http://biblicallyspeaking.fm/) &mdash; hosted by myself and [John Malone](http://biblestudy.net) &mdash; since the start of 2014.

The reason I've been *quietly* publishing it is because it took a bit for us to iron out the podcasting kinks. I love podcasting, but it still hasn't had its "Blogger moment"[^1].

The show is low on ceremony and (hopefully) high on content. It's just two guys talking to each other about the Bible. Asking questions and sometimes getting answers. We try to keep it "commute friendly", and if you enjoy the Bible at all, I think you'll enjoy the show.

If you don't currently enjoy the Bible (or think it's stupid, filled with old wives tails, etc., etc.), humor me and give it a listen. Who knows, we may surprise you.

We've published 49 shows so far. Here are a handful of my favorites:

* [Episode 1: I Can Stare Into a Campfire for Hours](http://biblicallyspeaking.fm/episodes/1-i-can-stare-into-a-campfire-for-hours/) &mdash; What does the Bible claim about itself? Can we know that God wrote it?

* [Episode 3: Word Fetcher](http://biblicallyspeaking.fm/episodes/3-word-fetcher/) &mdash; Are the individual words of the Bible inspired? Have they been preserved by God?

* [Episode 7: Salt Lick of Salvation](http://biblicallyspeaking.fm/episodes/7-salt-lick-of-salvation/) &mdash; A thorough explanation of the warning in Hebrews 6:3-8

* [Episode 19: Not Firing on Every Cylinder](http://biblicallyspeaking.fm/episodes/19-firing-every-cylinder/) &mdash; A must-listen for all the Mary worshipers out there.

* [Episode 21: Bible Tsunami](http://biblicallyspeaking.fm/episodes/21-bible-tsunami/) &mdash; Is the order of the books in the Bible divinely inspired or not?

* [Episode 32: The Hotness](http://biblicallyspeaking.fm/episodes/32-hotness/) &mdash; I BS on my own about pride and its effects.

Let me know what you think. If you like it, there are [plenty of ways to subscribe](http://biblicallyspeaking.fm/subscribe/)!
