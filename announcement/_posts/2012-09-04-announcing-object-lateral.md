I'm excited to announce my first foray into business ownership!

Well, technically, my *first* time owning a business was when I bought 20 shares of [KKD][krispy-kreme-doughnuts] right before the [Atkins Diet craze][atkins-diet]. Here's hoping I do a little better this time around ;)

I spent six great years working on networks and writing software for [RSDi][rsdi], but the time has come for me to venture out and see what I can do on my own.

The company is called [Object Lateral][objectlateral]. We write thoughtful, custom software.

For now that will mostly be software for hire, but I do have a few product ideas that I might pursue in tandem.

{% aside notice %}
The branding & design is by <a href="http://codyjamespeterson.com">Cody Peterson</a>, who is awesome (and available for contract).

Please take a moment to check out the site and let me know what you think!

We're also on the [Twitter][twitter], the [GitHub][github], and even the [FaceBook][facebook] if you're feeling social.

Oh yeah, and please do get in touch if you have software needs. I'd love to help in any way that I can!
