It's been quieter around these parts lately[^1], but that's not because I haven't been writing. If you keep up with me [on Twitter][twitter-jerod], you may have noticed that I've been [contributing][changelog-jerod] to [The Changelog][changelog] for the last few months!

I build my living on top of open source, so it's an honor and a privilege to help Adam, Andrew, and the team shine the spotlight on deserving projects.[^2]

Speaking of The Changelog... did you know it recently *eschewed advertisers* and is now run on [memberships][changelog-memberships] alone? That's pretty rad, if you ask me.

They also relaunched the podcast! Yours truly joined a live panel for the kickoff show last week, which you can listen to [here][changelog-085]. Oh, and if you aren't subscribed to the podcast, be sure to check [this page][changelog-podcast] for more info!

[^1]: I was publishing 1+ posts a week for awhile there, thanks to [Habit list][habit-list]

[^2]: If you want me to pimp your project on The Changelog, [email me][email-jerod] or hit me up [on Twitter][twitter-jerod]
