I just published my 2nd WordPress plugin, [Clean WP Dashboard][1].

WordPress 2.7's dashboard is a huge improvement over previous versions, but when you're running a site with many users sometimes you just want to simplify things. Enter [Clean WP Dashboard][1].

This plugin adds a simple administration page called "Dashboard Settings" which allows you to select/de-select which of the default WordPress widgets are available on the dashboard.

Source code is on my [GitHub account][2], as usual.
