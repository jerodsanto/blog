A little over a year ago, I [had the pleasure][ol-omahype] of helping my good friend[^1] [Cody][peterson] build the 3rd iteration of [Omahype][omahype]. I wasn't a user before the project, but I quickly became one after launch.

Omahype is *the* place to go when you want to find awesome events in the area. It wasn't long before Rachel and I began pining for a similar site specifically serving[^2] families.

We asked Cody if that was something he would help make happen, teamed up with our close friends/family (Jason and Sarah), and created [Out with Sprout][ows]: Omaha's Family Event Calendar.

[![Cody killed it with our branding, IMO][ows-image]][ows]

Out with Sprout's mission is to help families experience the best places &amp; events that Omaha has to offer. If you live in the area, have kids, and ever want to get out of the house and do something fun together, we think you'll love [Out with Sprout][ows]!
