I began hacking on Asterisk using the [Adhearsion][1] framework a few weeks ago. Despite initial setbacks, I am now having an absolute blast.

I put together a little [TextMate][2] bundle to aide in my development and figured Iâ€™d share it out as a starting point for others. I am not a TextMate or Adhearsion pro (yet) so I am sure there are a ton of improvements to be made.

So, please fork my [GitHub repo][4] and make improvements. We will all benefit from them!
