title: "Learning Cappuccino: A Linked List"
excerpt: "A list of valuable resources for learning Objective-J and the Cappuccino web framework."
---

Picking up a new framework can be a daunting task, especially if you're simultaneously learning a new language. I've done this before when I learned Ruby & Rails all in one fell swoop. It was not easy. I'm doing it again with Objective-J and [Cappuccino][1].

Along the way I've compiled a list of valuable resources. I believe many others will be taking this same journey in the coming days (especially once [Atlas][2] drops), so I'm sharing my findings for the benefit of all.

## Laying Foundation

[JavaScript: The Good Parts][3] - _the_ book to read on JavaScript

[Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X][4] - focus on the "how" of Cocoa

[Cocoa Design Patterns][5] - focus on the "why" of Cocoa

[Introduction to Cappuccino & Objective-J][6] - you've probably already read this

[Learning Objective-J][7] - this too, but if you haven't you absolutely should

[Objective-C for Rubyists][8] - great ($9) screencast if you're coming from a Ruby background like me

## Tutorials & Walk-Thrus

[Scrapbook Tutorial][9] - first "real" tutorial on cappuccino.org

[Nice-Panorama Tutorials][10] - great breadth of content here

[CappuccinoCasts][11] - Thomas does a great job with these. Watch 'em all

## Reference Material

[Cappuccino Online Documentation][12] - Unfortunately these are often outdated

[Compiling from source][13] - includes how to compile a local version of the documentation

[Apple's Cocoa Documentation][14] - Often fills the voids in Capp's documentation for certain topics

[Cocoa Browser Air][15] - A great tool for browsing Apple's documentation on a Mac

## Staying Informed

[Official Cappuccino Blog][16] - duh

[280 North's blog][17] - because they're driving this train

[This Week in Edge Cappuccino][18] - summaries of recent changes & additions

[CappuccinoFlow][19] - a link blog with content provided by the community

[GitHub repository][20] - if you're hardcore you can watch every commit to the project

## Getting Help

[Google Group][21] - good archives to search here as well

[IRC Channel][22] - direct IRC link

[Google Wave][23] - this is pretty new & I haven't personally used it much

That's what I've found & used so far. I plan on updating this page when I come across new helpful resources so come back from time to time and consider [subscribing to my blog][24] as well.

Also, let me know in the comments of Cappuccino resources you've found valuable and I'll add them to the list. Cheers!
