excerpt: "I had a great time chatting about building our platform with Elixir and Phoenix on Full Stack Radio."
---

Adam Wathan invited me on his excellent [Full Stack Radio](http://www.fullstackradio.com) podcast to talk about building [Changelog.com](https://changelog.com) with Elixir and Phoenix. Topics include:

- How pattern matching works in Elixir and why it's more powerful than method overloading in other languages
- How Elixir's pipe operator makes the transition from OO to functional programming more natural
- Why you don't need to be intimidated by unfamiliar features like GenServers to use Elixir for web app development
- Noticeable differences between working with Rails and Phoenix and what it was like to transition
- How the Phoenix ORM makes n+1 queries impossible
- Why background tasks are a lot easier in Elixir than in an ecosystem like PHP
- What other tools and technology power the Changelog platform
- How the Changelog Phoenix app is deployed

If you like listening to me blather on about software development, also take a listen to [Backstage #4](https://changelog.com/backstage/4) where I do exactly that with fellow-developer, Nick Janetakis. And, since we built our own custom platform, I can even do a shiny embed of that episode for ya! ðŸ™Œ
