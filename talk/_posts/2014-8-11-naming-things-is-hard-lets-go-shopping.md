title: "Naming Things is Hard. Let's Go Shopping!"
excerpt: "I speak to the Omaha Coffee & Code meetup about the trials and tribulations of naming things well."
---

I recently had the pleasure of presenting at [Omaha Coffee & Code](http://www.meetup.com/coffeeandcode/). My subject: the trials and tribulations of naming things (well).

The audience was a mix of developers and non-developers, so I kept it pretty high level. There are even some takeaways for naming things in general (websites, products, businesses, etc.)

I used a combination of QuickTime Player and my iPhone's Voice Memos app[^1] to put together a recording of the talk. It's a little noisy in the background (it was presented at a bustling coffee shop), but overall I think it turned out okay.

Added attractions include:

* animated gifs[^2]
* Napoleon Dynamite
* celebrity kid names
* photoshop'd[^3] Beyonc√© memes
* a Mitch Hedberg joke

Check it out!
