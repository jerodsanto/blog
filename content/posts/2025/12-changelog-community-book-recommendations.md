title: Changelog community book recommendations

Here's me, writing [in Changelog News](https://changelog.com/news/165) last October:

> I'm getting back in to reading. Not Audible. Not e-ink. I'm talking physical books held in my physical hands scanned by my physical eye balls.
>
> I need recommends! Please reply with **the best book** you've read in the last 10 years. Fiction. Non-fiction. Whatever!

I was overwhelmed by the response! There were too many thoughtful recommendations to keep them all to myself, so I jotted down each one, grabbed the synopses, and linked them up for everyone to peruse. 

_(Here they are, roughly in the order I received them.)_ 👇

I surely won't get around to reading all these, but there's a few that I'm definitely planning to check out. I already bought and am half way through _Project Hail Mary_. I was swayed by the upcoming [major motion picture](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12042730). It's been too long since I've been able to say, "the book was so much better!" 🤣
