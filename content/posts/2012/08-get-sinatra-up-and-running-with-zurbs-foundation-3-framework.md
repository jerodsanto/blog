title: Get Sinatra Up and Running with Zurb's Foundation 3 Framework

Many developers have become smitten with Twitter's [Bootstrap][bootstrap], but I'm personally more excited by what the [Zurb][zurb] team has drummed up for [Foundation 3][foundation].

Foundation uses the [Compass][Compass]/[Sass][sass] (scss) combo, which is awesome, but it takes a little work to get it to play nice with [Sinatra][sinatra].

I was going to write a How To blog post, but then I realized that a skeleton application that sets up the tricky bits would get people up and running even faster.

So, I created [sinatra-foundation-skeleton][sinatra-foundation-skeleton] for anybody interested in pairing these two power tools.

Oh, and it's wired up to easily deploy to [Heroku][heroku]. If you're into that sort of thing.
