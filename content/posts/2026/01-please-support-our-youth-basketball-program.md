The homeschool [basketball program](https://www.omahalightningbasketball.com) that all three of my boys play in (and I have coached in a volunteer capacity for ~10 years) is doing a little fundraiser to help keep registration fees low.

Please [check it out](https://app.99pledges.com/fund/omahalight1/levi-santo) and consider donating to Levi's campaign. He's [working hard](https://x.com/jerodsanto/status/2012199844920590593) to bring in as much support as he can!
