I have discovered a natural law of the Universe. 

I will call it **"The Chip Dip Depletion Principle"**, which states:

> Given sufficient snacking time, for any suitable chip/dip combination, the chip to dip ratio remains imbalanced until one of the two supplies are depleted.

**"Jerod's Chip Dip Depletion Principle"**, a practical example:

*"Yay, chips and dip! I'm going to eat some."*

/me: Snacks on chips and dip

*"Dratz! I am all out of chips, but still have dip. I need more chips."*

/me: Reloads chips

/me: Snacks on chips and dip

*"Dratz! I am all out of dip, but still have chips. I need more dip."*

/me: Reloads dip

/me: Snacks on chips and dip

*"Dratz! I am again all out of chips, but still have dip. I need more chips."*

/me: Repeats until one of the supplies is exhausted

/me: Fat and happy that **"Jerod's Chip Dip Depletion Principle"** holds true
