[Justin Searls](https://justin.searls.co) quit social media by posting more. How, exactly, did he do that? By writing way too much [Ruby code](https://github.com/searlsco/posse_party) to cross-post his blog to all the social networks using an atom feed of his design.

[POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) is an old idea: publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere. That's desirable, for sure, but not always easy to accomplish.

[POSSE Party](https://posseparty.com) is the new app Justin released so others can accomplish the same without all the work he went through.

I'm super lazy. So, last week I sat down, watched Justin's [Set up POSSE Party in 20 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQbmSDzSoKM), and followed all the steps. A few days later (lol, email delivery woes), I had [my own instance](https://posse.jerodsanto.net) up and running.

For now it's just posting to [Mastodon](https://changelog.social/@jerod) and [X](https://x.com/jerodsanto) with super minimal settings, but I plan on adding more networks and customizing everything as time allows.
