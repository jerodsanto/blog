God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to make people stop typing this drivel into `textarea`s near me.

1. Tell me you're $X without telling me you're $X[^1]
2. You 👏 don't 👏 have 👏 to 👏 clap 👏 between 👏 words[^2]
3. I was today years old when...[^3]
4. The. One. Where. Every. Word. Is. A. Sentence.[^4]
5. I don't know who needs to hear this...[^5]
6. I'm not crying, you're crying.[^6]
7. Six Seven[^7]

That's all for now. I'm sure I'll despise future phrases in the future. Before I go, here's one more from the past: ["automagically"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qvVK8U4TiA) is a dumb word (but makes for a [pretty good song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbWX15jASEw))

[^1]: Where $X = 'so annoying'
[^2]: Tell me you're desperate for attention without telling me desperate for attention
[^3]: It pains me to report I've used this one in earnest
[^4]: I treat this one like celebs with Epstein: claim I never used it, hope nobody digs up the past
[^5]: Nobody. The answer is always nobody needed to hear it
[^6]: Sir, this is a Wendy's
[^7]: I spent far too long deciding if this should be #6 or #7
