I recently stumbled across a spectacular nose dive in public perception that I thought would make a fun diversion. Can you figure out what dataset this trend represents?

I'll give you a few hints:

1.  I found it after watching a trailer for a movie set to release in June
2.  I'll reiterate &mdash; it is related to public perception
3.  The data is sourced from [IMDB][imdb]

Know what it is? Ready to find out?!

And the trend is...

Average IMDB ratings of movies directed by [M. Night Shyamalan](http://www.imdbcom/name/nm0796117/)!

Surprised? Probably not too much. He's been on quite the downward spiral since the glories days of [The Sixth Sense](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167404/) (8.2) and [Unbreakable](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217869/) (7.2).

The trailer that inspired this trend spotting was for the Shyamlan written/directed [After Earth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1815862/). I was surpised to find out that he was involved since the trailer doesn't mention his name once. Ouch.
