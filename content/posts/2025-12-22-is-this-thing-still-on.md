I've needed to refresh the ol' blog for *years*, but I never have the time. Thankfully, Claude Code compresses time *just enough* for me to finally get it done! All I need now is an obligatory "I refreshed my blog" blog post...

The last time I did this was forever ago. So long, in fact, that I cannot remember exactly when. 2013 maybe? I don't know. I didn't even write about it then. Here were my goals this time around:

- Graph paper theme: I [love](https://changelog.com/jsparty/275#transcript-22) graph paper!
- No categories or tags: unnecessary friction
- Blog from Obisidian: a symlink is all you need
- No analytics: I want to write to think, not to be read
- Switch from Jekyll to Hugo: faster builds, easier maintenance

There's still some kinks to iron out, but so far so good. Does this mean I'll write more here than I used to? Who knows, but at the very least I've removed all my excuses...
