Professionally I've been writing a ton of JavaScript lately, but in my free time I took a detour into the land of Cocoa to develop a tiny little Mac app. It only does one thing, but hopefully it does it well enough to get some use.

<a href="http://detoursapp.com/">Detours</a> is a GUI to manage your Mac's host lookups. Yes, you can already do this by manually editing <span class="keyword">/etc/hosts</span>, but I find that method difficult to explain to others, somewhat cumbersome and not very portable. Here's a shot of <a href="http://detoursapp.com">Detours</a> in action:

Please give it a try if you're on a Mac. I'd love some feedback.

Overall I really like developing for the Mac and have a few ideas of apps I might try to get in the upcoming App Store. There are a few pain points for me, but most of them are alleviated by the very exciting <a href="http://www.macruby.org/">MacRuby</a> project.

I'd like to give a huge <strong>THANKS</strong> to Cody Peterson of <a href="http://secretpenguin.com">Secret Penguin</a> for donating his time & skills to produce the <a href="http://detoursapp.com">Detours</a> icon & website. To be quite honest, I believe the artwork outshines the app itself. And I'm okay with that :)
