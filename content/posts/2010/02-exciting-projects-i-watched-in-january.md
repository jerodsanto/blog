One of my favorite [GitHub][1] features is the ability to find and track the progress of projects that interest me. I've decided to post the new projects I find each month on this blog since there is a high likelihood that you and I have common interests ([Hey, I'm curating something on the internet!][2]).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876" title="watch-3" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/watch-3.png" height="45" alt="" width="320" />

So I wrote a little script using the GitHub API to track which new projects I watch during each month. I watched 17 new projects in January. They are linked below along with their authors' descriptions and some commentary of my own:

**[BirdWatch][3]** - *"Twitter search client written in MacRuby"* I'm dying to give MacRuby a go, especially now that it has hit 0.5.

**[CPVideoKit][4]** - *"Cappuccino & Objective-J wrapper for the YouTube JavaScript API."* I love all the stuff coming out of the Cappuccino community lately.

**[Cappuccino-Test-Extensions][5]** - *"A group of extensions, classes, and more that aid developers in testing Cappuccino applications."*

**[EKImageReflection][6]** - *"With EKImageReflection you can extend a regular CPImageView for displaying a reflection on it's bottom."*

**[PNGSquash][7]** - *"A PNG compressor app for OS X."* Great tool for pre-processing images for web use.

**[coffee-script][8]** - *"Unfancy JavaScript."* This is easily the most active project I follow. Dude codes all day and night.

**[delayed_paperclip][9]** - *"Process your Paperclip attachments in the background with delayed_job."* A nice implementation joining two of my favorite Rails-related gems.

**[has_scope][10]** - *"Maps controller filters to your resource scopes."* Super-useful for filtering on index actions.

**[jQuery-Lint][11]** - *"jQuery Lint is a simple script you can download and use with jQuery. It works over the top of jQuery and diligently reports errors and any incorrect usage of jQuery."* - I want this to support Web Inspector.

**[jubilator][12]** - *"Browse public GitHub repos in style!"* Great for when you don't want to clone a repo just to grok its source.

**[makers-mark][13]** - *"Syntax highlight your markdown."* Could be useful for statically generated blogging.

**[nested_form][14]** - *"Rails plugin to conveniently handle multiple models in a single form."* 'Nuff said.

**[node-mongodb-native][15]** - *"Mongo DB Native NodeJS Driver."* Two technologies I'm looking for an excuse to play with.

**[rack-rewrite][16]** - *"A web server agnostic rack middleware for defining and applying rewrite rules. In many cases you can get away with Rack::Rewrite instead of writing Apache mod_rewrite rules."*

**[showoff][17]** - *"the best damn presentation software a developer could ever love."* Bold claim. We'll see.

**[twitter-node][18]** - *"node.js lib that creates a streaming connection with twitter and pushes any incoming statuses to a tweet event."* Could be a good learning tool.

**[webme][19]** - *"Convert your README into a Website."* Uhm, yes please!

That wraps it up for January. I hope you find one or more of these open-source projects interesting. Stay tuned for next month's list and [follow me][20] on GitHub to follow along!
