During the talk, I walked through building a little [Angular][angularjs] app called [Starlight][starlight]. I think it turned out not too bad.

[TechOmaha][techomaha] was awesome enough to record and publish a video of the talk, so here it is for your viewing pleasure. Be sure to watch it in full screen mode so you can actually read the code as it's discussed.

You can also check out [the slides][the-slides] and [the source code][starlight] of the web app built during the talk.

Thanks to [NebraskaJS][nebraskajs] for having me and all who came out!
