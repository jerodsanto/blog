I was honored to be interviewed by [Elmer Thomas](https://mobile.twitter.com/thinkingserious) for SendGrid's very cool [Some Coding Required](https://soundcloud.com/somecodingrequired) podcast. We talked about my favorite open source project, how open source has impacted my life, and gave some advice for open source contributors and maintainers.

My segment [starts right here](https://soundcloud.com/somecodingrequired/podcastinit6-oscon-2018-recap#t=7:19). Or listen to the whole thing. 14 minutes short.
