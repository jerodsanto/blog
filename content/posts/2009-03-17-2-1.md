A common practice when adding entries to crontab is to end the entry like this:

```bash
>/dev/null 2>&1
```

The purpose of this is to suppress any output from the command itself, because we're not interested. I picked up this syntax years ago because it just works, but I never knew what the `2>&1` actually meant, until today.

The first part:

```bash
>/dev/null
```


Means redirect `STDOUT` (the standard output stream) to `/dev/null` (which is basically a blackhole for bits). That's easy enough.

The second part:

```bash
2>&1
```

Means redirect `STDERR` (standard error stream) to the same place as `STDOUT` (which was just specified). `STDOUT` has the assigned number 1 and `STDERR` has the assigned number 2.

This way both `STDOUT` (1) and `STDERR` (2) are directed to `/dev/null` and all output of the cronned command is suppressed.
