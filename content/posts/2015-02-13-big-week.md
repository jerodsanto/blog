As I [teased][twitter-tease] on Monday, *two things* I'm excited about were announced this week.

It's always fun to finally share things you've been quietly toiling away on. For those of you who don't follow me on Twitter[^1], here's a recap of the news:

## Big News #1: We're putting on a conference!

The first annual [NebraskaJS Conference][nejsconf] will take place on August 7th, 2015 at the world famous [Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Doorly_Zoo_and_Aquarium).

This conf has been in planning for a long time, and I' couldn't be happier that we're able to make it official. There's a great group of organizers behind it. I'm sure it'll be a smashing success.

Ticketing info, the CFP, and more details are yet to be announced. Here are 2 great ways to stay in the loop:

1. Follow [nejsconf][nejsconf-twitter] on Twitter
2. Sign up for the [mailing list][nejsconf]

Oh, and you better believe [The Changelog][cl] team will be there in full force. Speaking of that...

## Big News #2: Adam is now working on The Changelog full time!

This is so huge for fans of our [podcast][cl-podcast], weekly [newsletter][cl-weekly], and/or [blog][cl].

Two years ago[^2] Adam set out to make The Changelog financially sustainable. That plan has paid off in spades. Thanks to our thriving [membership base][cl-membership] and the support of awesome sponsors he is now able to focus his entire attention on The Changelog.

There is so much more to say about this that we dedicated an entire post and [special podcast episode][cl-announcement] to the announcement. Check it out for all the gritty details and to get a peek at what this means for The Changelog's future[^3].

[^1]: I will forgive this temporary lapse in judgement, but it's high time you [redeem yourself][twitter]

[^2]: Right about the time I joined the team

[^3]: Spoiler alert: it's a bright one
