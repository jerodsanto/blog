    <p>The public release (and open sourcing) of <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a> was the big news in the open source world last week.</p>
<p>Discourse interested me mostly because it is a large-scale, production-ready Rails application which <a href="http://eviltrout.com/2013/02/10/why-discourse-uses-emberjs.html">uses Ember.js</a> for client-side MVC.</p>
<p>Any time I see an open source app which has technically intriguing bits, I take some time to clone it and give it a quick read-through. Let&rsquo;s do that!</p>
<h2 id="the-readme">The README</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start in the <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/3047d8afa3ae78b6e1722530577484921ce83b7f/README.md">README</a>, which is akin to the summary on the back of a book. Here we find out a few good signs. First, they have a developer <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md">install guide</a>, which means they&rsquo;re serious about attracting contributors. Next we learn the grand vision of the project, how to contribute, and the major technologies that the project uses. Very nicely done.</p>
<p>With that info in hand, let&rsquo;s poke around the actual source code and see what we see.</p>
<h2 id="the-gemfile">The Gemfile</h2>
<p>For Ruby apps, I usually start in <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/3047d8afa3ae78b6e1722530577484921ce83b7f/Gemfile">the Gemfile</a> to get a quick overview of the 3rd party libraries being used. Discourse has a <em>big</em> Gemfile, but nothing out of the ordinary given what we read in the README.</p>
<div class="notice">Some great gems in here: <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers">active_model_serializers</a>, <a href="http://nokogiri.org">nokogiri</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors">better_errors</a></div>
<p>Notably, there&rsquo;s a lot of Redis-related gems being used, RSpec for Ruby tests, looks like Jasmine for JavaScript tests, and Sinatra for some reason, even though it is not being <code>require</code>d.</p>
<h2 id="the-test-suite">The Test Suite</h2>
<p>After perusing the Gemfile, I look for tests next. We already know Discourse has them because of what we&rsquo;ve already seen, so we can go straight to the <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/tree/3047d8afa3ae78b6e1722530577484921ce83b7f/spec">spec/</a> directory and have a look around.</p>
<p>My first impression is that Discourse is very thoroughly tested. There are spec for models, views, controllers, mailers, fabricators, components and javascripts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m most curious about fabricators, because I don&rsquo;t know what they are, and javascripts, because I&rsquo;d like to see a well-tested Ember app.</p>
<p>Peeping in to the <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/3047d8afa3ae78b6e1722530577484921ce83b7f/spec/fabricators/post_fabricator.rb">PostFabricator</a>, it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a spec file at all. Instead, there are many <code>Fabricator</code> blocks, which call methods such as <code>raw</code>, <code>cooked</code>, <code>user</code>, <code>topic</code>, and <code>created_at</code>. My guess is that fabricators aren&rsquo;t a piece of the production system at all. They&rsquo;re probably some kind of factory for use in specs.</p>
<p>So, I move on to <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/3047d8afa3ae78b6e1722530577484921ce83b7f/spec/javascripts">specs/javascripts</a>. My first thought in this directory is that there aren&rsquo;t as many specs as I hoped. With how much Discourse relies on client-side MVC, you&rsquo;d think those components would be more thoroughly spec&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Oh well, you can&rsquo;t have it all, I guess.</p>
<h2 id="a-model">A Model</h2>
<p>The M in MVC is supposed to be where your application&rsquo;s business logic resides, so it&rsquo;s a logical next place to have a gander.</p>
<p>At this point I like to bring up the spec and implementation files side by side as I read. Let&rsquo;s just pick a single model and see what is up. Discourse is all about posting comments, so the <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/3047d8afa3ae78b6e1722530577484921ce83b7f/app/models/post.rb">Post</a> models seems like a good one to look at.</p>
<p>Opening <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/3047d8afa3ae78b6e1722530577484921ce83b7f/spec/models/post_spec.rb">specs/models/post_spec</a> confirms my assumption about the fabricators, as I see:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="display:flex;"><span>let<span style="color:#1f2328">(</span><span style="color:#032f62">:topic</span><span style="color:#1f2328">)</span> <span style="color:#1f2328">{</span> <span style="color:#0550ae">Fabricate</span><span style="color:#1f2328">(</span><span style="color:#032f62">:topic</span><span style="color:#1f2328">)</span> <span style="color:#1f2328">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>near the top of the file. Cool.</p>
<p>Opening <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/3047d8afa3ae78b6e1722530577484921ce83b7f/app/models/post.rb">app/models/post.rb</a> confirms my choice of Post as core to the system. This file is almost 500 lines long.</p>
<p>There are a couple things that worry me here.</p>
<p>First, they appear to be <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/3047d8afa3ae78b6e1722530577484921ce83b7f/app/models/post.rb#L329">sending email</a> from inside the model. I&rsquo;ve been guilty of this myself, but these days I try to keep email logic outside ActiveRecord descendants. I prefer it in a controller or separate domain class.</p>
<p>Second, and perhaps more dangerous to new devs, there are a bevy of callbacks being triggered, but they are not grouped together in the file. There&rsquo;s a series of them that starts <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/3047d8afa3ae78b6e1722530577484921ce83b7f/app/models/post.rb#L51">on line 51</a> and another series all the way down <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/3047d8afa3ae78b6e1722530577484921ce83b7f/app/models/post.rb#L302">on line 302</a>.</p>
<div class="notice">Grouping logically-related pieces of code together is one aspect of keeping code readable</div>
<p>Other than those two gripes, Post appears to be a decently factored, if not a little chubby, model.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to something more interesting.</p>
<h2 id="ember-stuff">Ember Stuff</h2>
<p>The entire reason that I wanted to read Discourse&rsquo;s source code is to see some production Ember stuff. Let&rsquo;s quit dawdling and hop into the good stuff.</p>
<p>Rails 3+ puts all the Coffee/JavaScript in <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/tree/3047d8afa3ae78b6e1722530577484921ce83b7f/app/assets/javascripts">app/assets/javascripts</a>, so it&rsquo;s no surprise to find a <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/tree/3047d8afa3ae78b6e1722530577484921ce83b7f/app/assets/javascripts/discourse">discourse</a> subdirectory in there with what appears to be an Ember app.</p>
<p>I decide to jump in to <a href="ttps://github.com/discourse/discourse/tree/3047d8afa3ae78b6e1722530577484921ce83b7f/app/assets/javascripts/discourse/models/post.js.coffee.erb">post.js.coffee.erb</a> first, because I already am familiar with the server-side Post model.</p>
<p>The first thing I notice is just in the filename itself. They&rsquo;re using CoffeeScript, which is cool, but they&rsquo;re also relying on ERB in their CoffeeScript files.</p>
<p>This sucks because many text editors will apply embedded Ruby styling/rules to the file even though it is mostly CoffeeScript with just a few Ruby snippets in there.</p>
<p>I try to avoid this if at all possible, but sometimes it&rsquo;s not easy. I want to see why they need ERB, so I open the file and do a quick search for &lsquo;&lt;%&rsquo;. This yields just 2 hits, on <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/3047d8afa3ae78b6e1722530577484921ce83b7f/app/assets/javascripts/discourse/models/post.js.coffee.erb#L178-L179">line 178 and 179</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-coffeescript" data-lang="coffeescript"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#953800">REGULAR_TYPE: </span><span style="color:#0550ae">&lt;%=</span> <span style="color:#1f2328">Post</span><span style="color:#0550ae">::</span><span style="color:#1f2328">REGULAR</span> <span style="color:#0550ae">%&gt;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#953800">MODERATOR_ACTION_TYPE: </span><span style="color:#0550ae">&lt;%=</span> <span style="color:#1f2328">Post</span><span style="color:#0550ae">::</span><span style="color:#1f2328">MODERATOR_ACTION</span> <span style="color:#0550ae">%&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I think they&rsquo;re trying keep things DRY by reusing server-side constants to define JS globals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve avoided ERB in this scenario by embedding the variables into the DOM somewhere (such as data- attributes on &lt;body&gt;) and then grabbing them out in JS.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Ember lets you do this, but it save the hassle of pre-processing CoffeeScript with ERB.</p>
<p>Speaking of DRY, I&rsquo;m curious if there is much duplication between the Ruby Post model and the CoffeeScript Post model.</p>
<p>Reusing models on the client and server is an oft-cited panacea provided by server-side JavaScript, and Rails doesn&rsquo;t provide such a convenience.</p>
<p>Does it matter in the case of Discourse&rsquo;s Post model? You can judge for yourself, but in my small time reading both files I would say no, not at all.</p>
<h2 id="way-more">Way More</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to this app, and I definitely suggest giving it a read, but I will stop here because this post is already too long.</p>
<p>Reading large, production-ready open source projects is a great way to learn new techniques, see how people you admire solve complex problems, and even find places <a href="http://grantammons.me/2013/02/09/making-some-discourse-code-a-little-better/">where you can help</a>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read a lot of other people&rsquo;s code, you are probably nodding your head in agreement.</p>
<p>If not, I highly recommend it, and hopefully this post will give you a bit of a process you can follow to dive in with confidence and quickly understand what is going on.</p>
