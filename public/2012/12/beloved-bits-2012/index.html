<h2 id="ios-apps">iOS Apps</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that iOS 7 does some much-needed innovating on my favorite operating system, but the app ecosystem is still head and shoulders above other platforms.</p>
<h3 id="habit-list">Habit List</h3>
<p><a href="http://habitlistapp.com/">Habit List</a> jumped up and surprised me. The conceipt is a simple one: enter things you want to turn into habits and track how you&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s not social, it&rsquo;s not revolutionary, and it&rsquo;s not even complex to implement, but it <em>is</em> working for me.</p>
<p>Habits I&rsquo;ve been developing with the aid of this app include shaving regularly (which I <em>abhor</em>), flossing, blogging, exercising, and more.</p>
<p><img src="http://jerodsanto.net/drop/habit-list-pic.png" alt="I&rsquo;m getting a late start on exercising this week!"></p>
<p>The best part? Once you get a streak going it compells you not to blow it! Oh, and they just released a pretty awesome 2.0 as I write this post. Good stuff.</p>
<h3 id="sports-scores--alerts">Sports Scores &amp; Alerts</h3>
<p>I had been a long time <a href="http://mobile.yahoo.com/sports/iphone">Sportacular</a> user until Yahoo! acquired it and turned it into Craptacular. This year I went hunting for something better to track various sporting events<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and boy did I find it.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sports-scores-alerts/id432450349?mt=8">Sports Scores &amp; Alerts</a> is fast, easy to use, works reliably, and is really really fast. Did I mention that it&rsquo;s fast?</p>
<p>It has all the in-game push notifications I could want and an interesting freemium business model where subscribing via in-app purchase unlocks more concurrent alerts and other features.</p>
<p>I am not a huge sports nut, so the free stuff gets me where I want to go. I do hope that this model is working for them, though, because I love the app and would hate to have it acquired by some behemoth that ruins it.</p>

<h2 id="os-x-apps">OS X Apps</h2>
<p>OS X is my work horse. My favorite OS X apps are almost always tools and utilities. This year is no exception, with three tools I use to make my work/life more efficient.</p>
<h3 id="dash">Dash</h3>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dash-docs-snippets/id458034879?mt=12">Dash</a> has become one of a handful of apps that I have running all day, every day. It is a code snippet manager teamed with a documentation browser.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not much of a code snippet guy myself, so I mostly use Dash for docs, but boy do I love it for that purpose.</p>
<p>It so nice having offline, auto-updating, searchable docsets for every language/framework/toolset I use. I can hardly remember life before Dash.</p>
<p><img src="http://jerodsanto.net/drop/dash.png" alt="Look at all those shiny docsets"></p>
<p>Oh, and Dash punts to Google or Stack Overflow if it can&rsquo;t find what I&rsquo;m looking for, so there&rsquo;s really no reason to not use it every time I need a reference.</p>
<h3 id="imageoptim">ImageOptim</h3>
<p><a href="http://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a> is a great little utility. It wraps up all the best image optimization tools (OptiPNG, PNGCrush, etc.) in a nice drag-and-drop interface.</p>
<p>It handles many image types and modifies them in place, showing me the savings.</p>
<p><a href="http://imageoptim.com/"><img src="http://jerodsanto.net/drop/image-optim.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I love finding tools like IMageOptim that do one thing well and make my life as a webdev easier.</p>
<h3 id="cloudapp">CloudApp</h3>
<p><a href="http://getcloudapp.com/">CloudApp</a> got my business because Evernote acquired Skitch and then released a terrible, terrible update to the software.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> It wasn&rsquo;t too much of a surprise, but it turned out to be just as awesome as so many people had told me.</p>
<p>The killer feature? The app shows you how many people have viewed the link you sent them, so you can know <em>for sure</em> whether they saw it or not.</p>
<p><a href="http://getcloudapp.com/"><img src="http://jerodsanto.net/drop/cloudapp.png" alt="this is super handy when sending mockups to clients and collaborators"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like read receipts for files!</p>

<h2 id="games">Games</h2>
<p>I was once an avid gamer. Then I became a once-avid gamer. Thanks to iOS and the rise of &ldquo;casual gaming&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m slowly returning to form.</p>
<h3 id="hero-academy">Hero Academy</h3>
<p>When it comes to gaming and me, 2012 has been the year of <a href="http://www.robotentertainment.com/games/heroacademy">Hero Academy</a>. In fact, this epic strategy game became such a staple in my life that it made an appearance at my 30th birthday&hellip;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>My favorite one was the Hero Academy cupcake. It tasted like victory. <a href="http://t.co/QWd51STd" title="http://twitter.com/jerodsanto/status/227029340964134912/photo/1">twitter.com/jerodsanto/sta…</a></p>&mdash; Jerod Santo (@jerodsanto) <a href="https://twitter.com/jerodsanto/status/227029340964134912" data-datetime="2012-07-22T13:16:29+00:00">July 22, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>As of today I&rsquo;ve racked up 404 wins on Hero Academy and I have 14 games in-progress right now.</p>
<p>My wife says I&rsquo;m addicted. She might be right.</p>
<h3 id="bastion">Bastion</h3>
<p>The only game that was compelling enough to rip me away from Hero Academy has been <a href="http://supergiantgames.com/?page_id=242">Bastion</a>.</p>
<p>Bastion is a totally unique and stylish RPG that completely blew me away. It&rsquo;s available on many platforms, but I played it on the iPad and it was a near perfect video game experience.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TptJHeWngJs?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t played Bastion yet, you really need to get on that.</p>

<h2 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h2>
<p>I cycled through a bunch of podcasts this year, but there&rsquo;s only a couple that have earned must-listen status  in my podcast rotation.</p>
<h3 id="the-vergecast">The Vergecast</h3>
<p>This year, The <a href="http://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast">Vergecast</a> took the place of <a href="http://twit.tv">TwiT</a> as my weekly technology-culture commentary podcast. The two shows are similar in their format and topics, but The Vergecast is hands down more interesting to me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast"><img src="http://jerodsanto.net/drop/vergecast.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The hosts are funnier, the insights are more insightful, and the rabbit holes are deeper. Plus they take calls sometimes which always result in hilarity.</p>
<h3 id="giant-robots-smashing-into-other-giant-robots">Giant Robots Smashing into Other Giant Robots</h3>
<p>Leave it to the Thoughtbot team to enter a crowded market of programming discussion podcasts and still shine by way of great guests, deep insights into development processes, and episode lengths that are just right.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://learn.thoughtbot.com/podcast">Giant Robots Smashing into Other Giant Robots</a> is definitely worth checking out. A few of my favorite episodes so far are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Episode 28: <a href="http://learn.thoughtbot.com/podcast/28">Farther, further, faster</a></li>
<li>Episode 19: <a href="http://learn.thoughtbot.com/podcast/19">I have tons of guns and knives</a></li>
<li>Episode 18: <a href="http://learn.thoughtbot.com/podcast/18">Trading Hours for Money</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t include a music category last year, but thanks to signg up for <a href="http://rdio.com/">Rdio</a> this year, I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot more new stuff. Speaking of Rdio&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="rdio">Rdio</h3>
<p>The biggest thing to happen to my musical life in 2012 was signing up for <a href="http://rdio.com/">Rdio</a>. I&rsquo;ve always naysayed subscription-based music services because I like to take ownership of music that I love, but working alone most days means I spend a lot of time listening to music and even my sizeable collection gets old quickly.</p>
<p>I gave Spotify a try first, but their interface was such utter crap that I couldn&rsquo;t stomach it.</p>
<p>Rdio to the rescue. Getting to sample from all of the newest music each week is an utter joy. Finally, a reason to look forward to Tuesdays!</p>
<h3 id="blunderbuss">Blunderbuss</h3>
<p>If I had to pick an album of the year, it&rsquo;d be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blunderbuss-Jack-White/dp/B007CKNX28?tag=jerodsanto-20">Blunderbuss</a> by Jack White. Everything Jack White puts out is good, and his first solo album is no exception. Every song on this album is interesting and unique, yet it feels like a cohesive work.</p>
<iframe width="500" height="250" src="https://rd.io/i/QVNNbyJI2hc" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<h3 id="the-sounds">The Sounds</h3>
<p><a href="http://the-sounds.com/">The Sounds</a> are not a new band, but they sure are new to me! It&rsquo;s not too often that I come across a band and immediately enjoy their entire collection, but I was happy to have that experience this year with The Sounds.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a taste of the goods:</p>
<iframe width="500" height="250" src="https://rd.io/i/QVNNbyJWmus" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<h3 id="propaganda">Propaganda</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t usually get down with contemporary Christian music, especially Christian rap music. Most of it just feels like low-quality imitations of the real thing.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/prophiphop">Propaganda</a>, on the other hand, is the real deal. This man is a face-melting rapper and a poet. Here&rsquo;s Propaganda on empowerment:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8E28ovlb77Q?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>His entire album is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Excellent/dp/B0096MDWC6?tag=jerodsanto-20">Excellent</a>. You should buy it.</p>
<p><strong>Honorable Mentions:</strong> Grizzly Bear&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shields-Grizzly-Bear/dp/B008966SIU?tag=jerodsanto-20">Shields</a>, Imagine Dragons&rsquo; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Night-Visions-Imagine-Dragons/dp/B008K9SG9K?tag=jerodsanto-20">Night Visions</a>, Tycho&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dive-Tycho/dp/B005ILYN5E?tag=jerodsanto-20">Dive</a>, Birdy&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Birdy/dp/B00722ZHG6?tag=jerodsanto-20">self-titled album</a></p>
<h2 id="things-that-ended">Things that Ended</h2>
<p>Alas, 2012 wasn&rsquo;t just about the new. Some of my favorite digital things came to a close.</p>
<h3 id="trs">TRS</h3>
<p>I had been watching the <a href="http://revision3.com/trs">Totally Rad Show</a> since way back in their first season. That&rsquo;s long enough to feel like Alex, Jeff, and Dan are close friends of mine even though they&rsquo;ve never met me. Weird, huh?</p>
<p>I lived much of my geeky life vicariously through TRS. I don&rsquo;t have time to play all the new video games, see every movie that comes out, or keep up with all the great TV shows, but TRS made me feel like I did all that and more by watching the guys review, preview, and speculate on these things.</p>
<p>I hope something will step up and fill the void that TRS leaves in my daily routine, but I doubt I&rsquo;ll be so lucky.</p>
<h3 id="hypercritical">Hypercritical</h3>
<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical">Hypercritical</a> with John Siracusa made my <a href="/2011/12/beloved-bits-2011/">Beloved Bits</a> list last year. John is calling it quits, after recording 100 glorious episodes.</p>
<p>Over the last year I went from enjoying John&rsquo;s rants on technology to flat out adoring them. It is the one podcast that I look forward to every week and I&rsquo;ll miss it quite a bit.</p>
<p>Thankfully, John will still be making regular appearances on <a href="http://5by5.tv/incomparable">The Incomparable</a>, another pretty good geek culture podcast that I&rsquo;ve been listening to lately. It&rsquo;s not the same, but it&rsquo;ll have to do for now.</p>
<h2 id="quid-pro-quo">Quid Pro Quo</h2>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s my list. I hope you find one or more of these things as enjoyable and/or useful as I have.</p>
<p>Please do recommend any of your most beloved digital things of 2012 in the comments so I can discover them in 2013!</p>
