    <p>There was a brief period in high school when I was BIG in to the WWF.</p>
<p>It was a great time to be a wrestling fan. Stone Cold Steve Austin was chugging beers and delivering <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqDCKzHTsI">Stunners</a>, Degeneration X was regularly insisting that their opponents <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snW-5AHxYTA">Suck It</a>, and The Rock was the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeTLK2DsBDc">People&rsquo;s Champ</a> (can you smell it?).</p>
<p><img src="http://jerodsanto.net/drop/peoples-champ-20120605-170058.png" alt="The People&rsquo;s Champ"></p>
<p>During this less-discerning-phase of my life, a Classy wrestler by the name of Val Venis burst onto the scene. The ladies loved him. Well, at least that&rsquo;s what he kept repeating every time he got his paws on the mic.</p>
<p><img src="http://jerodsanto.net/drop/venis-20120605-140149.png" alt="Val Venis"></p>
<p>Val Venis&rsquo;s shtick cracked me up, so I would often quote him (&ldquo;Hello Ladies&rdquo;) at football practices, beer die games, or pretty much anywhere that I had a male audience.</p>
<p>Val Venis often referred to himself as the Big Valboski, and I imitated the guy often enough that a few of my friends began calling me the Big Santoski. That name was either too verbose or I wasn&rsquo;t big enough, because it was soon shortened to Santoski, Toski, or even just Tosk by those into the whole brevity thing.</p>
<p>Somehow the name stuck. Nicknames work like that. You don&rsquo;t pick a nickname. It picks you.</p>
<p>When I finally needed a handle on the Internet — I didn&rsquo;t own a computer until I was 17 and even then I rarely used the Internet —  I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything awesome so I just went with what people already called me. I threw a few 1337 vowel replacements in there for good measure and have been sant0sk1 ever since.</p>
<p>Until today.</p>
<p>Today I&rsquo;m putting sant0sk1 to death. Murderous? I suppose. Tragic? Nah. But you may be wondering why.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you why!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s not objectively awesome</strong> — some handles are so cool that they should never be abandoned. <a href="https://twitter.com/notch">Notch</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mechanical_fish">mechanical_fish</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tenderlove">tenderlove</a> come to mind. sant0sk1 isn&rsquo;t <em>bad</em>, but it&rsquo;s nowhere near an untouchable level of cool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>People can&rsquo;t pronounce it</strong> — Some people who have only ever read my handle online think it&rsquo;s pronounced sant-zero-s-k-one. Weird, I know, but it happens more than you&rsquo;d think. This makes for first IRL encounters of the awkward kind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m not Polish</strong> — I didn&rsquo;t even know this was a thing, but it turns out that the &ldquo;ski&rdquo; suffix is common amongst Polish names. There&rsquo;s only two things I hate in this world. People who are intolerant of other people&rsquo;s cultures and the Polish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My name is my name</strong> — As a contract software developer, I travel on my name. Anything that disconnects my work from my real name could be detrimental to that purpose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From now on I&rsquo;m just going to be boring like so many others and use my full name. I&rsquo;ve already changed my username on my most frequented accounts: <a href="https://twitter.com/jerodsanto">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jerodsanto">GitHub</a>. The others will follow as time permits.</p>
<p>Good bye, sant0sk1. It was good when it was good.</p>
