    <p>To celebrate episode 100 of Jaymie Jones&rsquo; <a href="http://codercatchup.com">Coder Catchup</a> podcast, Jaymie reached out to a handful of people and asked us 5 questions about web development, which he then read on the show.</p>
<p>I was honored to be on the show alongside such great web folks as Chris Coyier, Wes Bos, Adam Stacoviak, Sarah Allen, and more.</p>
<p>Since I wrote my answers to Jaymie in Markdown and shipped them off for him to read, I figured I&rsquo;d also post them here as well.</p>
<p>But still, you should <a href="http://codercatchup.com/episodes/55598-episode-100-one-hundred">listen to his Episode 100</a> since there are many great answers to the questions below. Enjoy!</p>
<h3 id="1-if-you-were-starting-fresh-what-would-you-primarily-focus-on-eg-as-a-new-web-designerdeveloper">1. If you were starting fresh, what would you primarily focus on? (e.g. as a new web designer/developer)</h3>
<p>Beginners <em>shouldn&rsquo;t focus</em> much, I don&rsquo;t think. This is why many 101 level courses are surveys of an entire field. It&rsquo;s important to get the lay of the land before focusing in on one or a few things. How else can you get a sense of what&rsquo;s worth focusing on?</p>
<p>In web development, I think that means learning how the web works as a system. Clients, servers, DNS, HTTP(s), and HTML are the underpinnings of the web that should be understood first. Then, I&rsquo;d try to use that knowledge to publish a website, soup-to-nuts. Once you can do that on your own, the opportunities really open up for you.</p>
<h3 id="2-what-is-one-piece-of-advice-you-think-is-most-important-for-web-developersdesigners-going-forward">2. What is one piece of advice you think is most important for web developers/designers going forward?</h3>
<p>Generalize. Technologies come to fame then fall from favor faster than boy bands. If you gained expertise in Thing A by burying your head in it and ignoring Things B, C, and D, your skills may be quite marketable today and <em>completely irrelevant</em> tomorrow. On the other hand, if you keep your eyes on Things A through D while working with maybe B and C, you stand a much better chance of remaining valuable as things change.</p>
<p>If we look at our ongoing education in terms of breadth and depth, my advice (and practice) is to go for breadth habitually and go for depth when the need arises.</p>
<h3 id="3-what-would-you-do-to-get-out-of-a-slump-or-plateau-with-your-web-career">3. What would you do to get out of a slump or plateau with your web career?</h3>
<p>This depends on what you mean by slump, but I&rsquo;ll assume it means waning interest in the web and my work on it. In this case, I&rsquo;ve found that side projects are great slump busters. Working on a side project that I care about energizes me and helps me power through times of low motivation, especially if they&rsquo;re challenging and push me outside of my comfort zone. Frankly, that&rsquo;s one of my favorite things about working on Changelog. Producing awesome content for developers is an entirely different challenge from writing software itself. Plus, it usually means hacking on a few things along the way!</p>
<h3 id="4-what-is-1-thing-you-would-like-to-see-web-developersdesigners-doing-more-of">4. What is 1 thing you would like to see web developers/designers doing more of?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see web developers and designers focus more on the fundamentals and less on bleeding edge features and new techniques. Get the basics right: quality content, ease of use, and speed of delivery. The rest is just icing on the cake.</p>
