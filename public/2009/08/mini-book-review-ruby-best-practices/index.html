    <p>I just finished reading Gregory Brown&rsquo;s &ldquo;<strong>Ruby Best Practices</strong>&rdquo; (RBP). I could probably write a book about this book, but I hate long book reviews so I&rsquo;ll try to keep this short.</p>
<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>
<p>If you are an intermediate-to-expert Ruby programmer you should absolutely read this book. Beginners may want to start elsewhere and work their way up. <a href="#wheretobuy">Where To Get It</a></p>
<h2 id="in-detail">In Detail</h2>
<p>The beauty and power of Ruby is its dynamism which leads to freedom. The problem with freedom is it means <a href="%22http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it%22">TMTOWTDI</a>. The problem with <a href="%22http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it%22">TMTOWTDI</a> is best summarized by me, in a quote of myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There is more than one way to do it but most of them are really, really bad.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, we can combat these bad coding methods by resorting to helpful idioms and best practices, and Ruby has these in spades. The purpose of <strong>RBP</strong> is stated plainly on the front cover:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Increase Your Productivity &ndash; Write Better Code&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that in mind, here is a breakdown of what it offers:</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed when reading <strong>RBP</strong> is that it uses real-world code samples. None of that &ldquo;let&rsquo;s make a tic-tac-toe game&rdquo; type of stuff. Gregory uses a couple of his own projects (Prawn &amp; Ruport) as well as other popular libraries (Haml, flexmock, XML Builder, Gibberish, faker). This is beyond awesome.</p>
<p>He also steps through a lot of code using IRB, which means you can follow right along in your favorite shell. Gregory highly recommends you get your hands dirty with the code he presents and I agree with him. However, I also like to read physical books in places not my computer, since the opportunity so rarely presents itself.</p>
<p>The book starts, aptly, with a chapter on testing. The following two chapters are (for me) the highlights:</p>
<p><em><strong>Designing Beautiful APIs</strong></em> and <em><strong>Mastering the Dynamic Toolkit</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The value found in these two sections alone cover the cost of the entire book. A few of the topics discussed include: flexible argument handling, code blocks, implementing per-object behavior, building classes and modules programatically and registering hooks and callbacks. Gregory released a free section of <em><strong>Mastering the Dynamic Toolkit</strong></em> so you don&rsquo;t have to take my word for it, <a href="%22http://cdn.oreilly.com/books/9780596523008/Mastering_the_Dynamic_Toolkit.xml.pdf%22">have a taste for yourself.</a></p>
<p>I need to wrap this up or I&rsquo;ll be forced to remove the &ldquo;<strong>Mini</strong>&rdquo; from the post title. You&rsquo;ll also find sections on File &amp; Text processing, functional programming, debugging, project maintenance (much of which is obsolete if you use the wonderful <a href="%22http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/%22">Jeweler gem</a>), and internationalization.</p>
<p>Tips, tricks and suggestions abound. Even expert-level Rubyists should learn something. <strong>RBP</strong> left me wanting more of Gregory&rsquo;s teaching. He really does a good job of explaining concepts and walking through code. Thankfully, he started up a <a href="%22http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/%22">Ruby Best Practices blog</a> with more content!</p>
<h3 id="wheretobuy">Where to Buy</h3>
<p><strong>RBP</strong> is an O&rsquo;Reilly publication and they have it on sale at their web site for <strong>$34.99</strong>.</p>
<p>However, I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;d do that because Amazon has it for <strong>$23.10</strong> and eligible for free shipping with Amazon Prime. Booyah!</p>
<p>If you go that route, use <a href="%22http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596523009?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=standadeviat-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596523009%22">this link</a> to pitch me a little something for the effort, or just buy directly via <a href="%22http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Best-Practices-Gregory-Brown/dp/0596523009/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1249140448&amp;sr=8-1%22">this link</a>.</p>
