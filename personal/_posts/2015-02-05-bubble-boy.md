excerpt: "Walking around in a bubble of grace."
---

I’m at the tail end of a couple-day sickness. Nothing serious. I was just miserable enough to put on my woe-is-me attitude, but no worse.

It’s times like these &mdash; when I’m laying in bed feeling sorry for myself so leave me alone and slam the door on your way out thank you very much &mdash; when I try to make my elementary school teachers proud and “turn that frown upside down”. The only way I can get that done is by doing some honest-to-goodness reflection on my life.

It’s been over ten years since I first came to my senses and received Christ for who he is; the son of the living God. Ten years is almost *1/3 of my life*. I’ve had peace with God for so long now that I’m beginning to forget what life was like without it.

To say that my life has changed since that Summer of ’04 is a gross understatement. I’d love to list the ways in which the Lord has blessed me since I started following him, but I fear it might come across as boastful[^1].

Instead, I’ll just say this. For the past decade I’ve been walking around in a bubble of grace.

Nothing outside can harm me. All that I need is provided. It is truly remarkable. Reminds me of something the Lord said once:

> I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it *more abundantly*.

Life more abundant, indeed.



[^1]: My boast would be in the Lord, not in myself. But that’s a distinction that people struggle to make sometimes.
